Extremely simple 2D peridynamics
------------------------------------------------

The test file can be run by executing ./run.sh
this will generate a video file called output.avi
in the plots folder.

The parameters of the test can be changed in test.jl

If the PyPlot and ODE libraries are not previously installed:
using Pkg
Pkg.update()
Pkg.add("PyPlot")
Pkg.add("DifferentialEquations")

This version is tested with julia v1.0.0
